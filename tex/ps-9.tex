You {\it must} label all axes of all plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Exercise 8.6 in Newman. 
\item Exercise 8.7 in Newman. Before approaching the problem
  numerically, show that set of possible values of $R$, $\rho$, $C$,
  $m$, and $g$ maps to a one-parameter family of solutions, which in
  terms of a typical timescale $T$ is controlled by the combination
  $R^2\rho C g T^2/m$. That is, show that if you rescale variables
  from $t$ to $t'/T$ and from $x$ to an appropriate $x'$, you get a
  unitless set of equations with one free (unitless) parameter.
\end{enumerate}
