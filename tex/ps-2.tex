You {\it must} label all axes of any plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Figure out how NumPy's 32-bit floating point representation
    (which is the IEEE standard) represents the number $100.98763$ in
    bits. By how much does the actual number differ from its 32-bit
    floating point representation?

  \item Exercise 2.9 of Newman. Note that the physical constants drop
    out so you do not need to worry about them (whenever possible you
    should seek to remove physical constants from the innards of your
    computations!).  Write two versions of the code, one which uses a
    {\tt for} loop and one which does not.  Use {\tt \%timeit} to
    determine which is faster.

  \item Exercise 3.7 of Newman.  Note that you can use a NumPy array
    to perform the iterations for each value of $c$ all at once, which
    will be much faster than using a {\tt for} loop over $c$.

  \item Exercise 4.2 of Newman. For Part (c), put your solver into a
    {\it module} that can be imported. Call the module {\tt
      quadratic}, and your function within it {\tt quadratic}. Create
    a file called {\tt test\_quadratic.py} with the contents shown
    below, and ensure that the call {\tt pytest test\_quadratic.py}
    returns no errors. This is a simple example of a unit test.
\begin{verbatim}
import pytest

import numpy as np
import quadratic

def test_quadratic():
    # Check the case from the problem
    x1, x2 = quadratic.quadratic(a=0.001, b=1000., c=0.001)
    assert (np.abs(x1 - (- 1.e-6)) < 1.e-10)
    assert (np.abs(x2 - (- 0.999999999999e+6)) < 1.e-10)

    # Check a related case to the problem
    x1, x2 = quadratic.quadratic(a=0.001, b=-1000., c=0.001)
    assert (np.abs(x1 - (0.999999999999e+6)) < 1.e-10)
    assert (np.abs(x2 - (1.e-6)) < 1.e-10)

    # Check a simpler case (note it requires the + solution first)
    x1, x2 = quadratic.quadratic(a=1., b=8., c=12.)
    assert (np.abs(x1 - (- 2.)) < 1.e-10)
    assert (np.abs(x2 - (- 6)) < 1.e-10)
\end{verbatim}
