You {\it must} label all axes of all plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercise 5.17 in Newman.
  \item Download a ``signal'' as a function of time from
    \href{https://github.com/blanton144/computational-grad/blob/main/data/signal.dat}{this
      file}. Assume that all the measurements have the same
    uncertainty (with a standard deviation of 2 in the signal units,
    though it doesn't affect what you do much in this problem).
    \begin{enumerate}[a]
      \item Use the SVD technique to find the best third-order
        polynomial fit in time 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
